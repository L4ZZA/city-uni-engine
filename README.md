# Development

1. Create and account on [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org)
2. Fork the main repository.
	1. go to [main_repo](https://bitbucket.org/L4ZZA/engine/src/develop/).
	2. Click on the 'plus' button on the left to fork a repository.
	3. Press on fork this repository.
3. Install [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com) (recommended)
4. Clone your forked repository into your machine.
5. Read the section below and start developing.

## Workflow
Before starting with the fun, some precautions:
- Always keep your local repository up to date with the remote one, by pulling the new changes as soon as they're available (on GitKraken it will show as an arrow down next to the branch name on the left).
- Whatever you are going to do, never work directly on develop or on master branch. These to branches should be populated through merges (pull-requests).
- Create your branch from wherever you need to (most likely develop) but before that just make sure your local develop is up-to-date with the remote one (a.k.a origin)

## Comments
Anything that is not clear from the above instructions or from the code, create a descriptive issue on bitbucket and I'll try to make it clearer by resolving it.
